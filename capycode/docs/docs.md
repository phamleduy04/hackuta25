Eleven labs for TTS; make it a call function, like Gemini has. Interactive questions and feedback. This is a coding coach who will teach you how to code your own app. It will have modules, and each module will open its own editor in which you have to implement a certain thing, while a live agent/character will guide and help you to learn and actually go through it.

Sandbox in the frontend for coding, sample code editor

Gemini api reviewing code

Have two different screens, one is a code editor and the second is a preview of the code

4 pages: landing, dashboard, actual program, and result page(Angry Birds reference)

Landing:
Use Figma AI for a landing page
Also, use a landing page from Zentra to make a landing page, and base the landing page on Zentra

Dashboard:
Course selection
Can give your own app


Use capybara as mascot that speaks(cartoon voice(maybe))
Animations on all 3 pages
Character(capybara) on all 3 pages. Figure out how to fit it into the program page
